This is a fork of [mps-youtube](https://github.com/mps-youtube/mps-youtube "mps-youtube").

Differs from the official version by adding a feature for allowing musicbrainz
album searches to be used to format the metadata for downloaded playlists and
also creates a `.m3u` file for downloaded playlists.
